== Variables
[source,python]
----
# Values can be stored with as variables in Python. 
# You can think of it as giving different values a name so you can refer to them by that name later in your code.
# Be careful when naming your variables - spaces indicate that it's the end of the variable. 
# Capitalisation is also important.

group_1 = 2
group_2 = 2

# You can refer to these stored variables by calling their names
group_1 + group_2

=== Challenge
[source,python]

# What's wrong with the code below?
# Challenge 1
z + 100

# Challenge 2
group 1 = 1
group 1 + 1

# Challenge 3
group1 = 1
group2 = 2
Group1 + group2

# Challenge 4
a = 100
b = 0
a/b

# Challenge 1: z hasn't been defined (you haven't assigned a value to z)
# Challenge 2: There is a space in the variable name "group 1" - should be "group1" or "group_1"
# Challenge 3: "Group1" in should be spelt as "group1" in the line that says Group1 + group2
# Challenge 4: In mathematics, any values divided by zero is undefined.

== Data types
[source,python]
----
# So far we have looked at integers (int)
type(1)
type(2)

# In Python, you can also have float, whch are numbers with decimal places
type(1.0)
type(1.2)

# You can check the type for a variable
a = 1
b = 1.2
type(a)
type(b)

# You can turn a float into an integer (this will "floor" the value)
int(3.3)
int(3.9)

# Checking the variable types can be extremely useful when you're trying to follow a tutorial or troubleshooting.
----

== String
[source,python]
----
# You can store a mixture of numbers and letters as strings by putting them in quotation marks
s1 = "abc"
s2 = "def123"

# You can use either single/double quotation
s1 = 'abc'
s2 = "abc"

# Numbers inside quotes are considered to be strings, even if they look like numbers
s3 = "123"

# You can add 2 strings together
"abc" + "def"

# You can convert numbers to string, or number-like strings into numbers
x = str(123)
y = int("123")
type(x)
type(y)

# You can convert all the characters in a string from lower case to upper case or vice versa
sequence = "aTCGAgcT"
sequence.upper()
sequence.lower()

=== Challenge
[source,python]
----
# What's wrong with the code below?
# Challenge 1
s1 = def
s1 + "g"

# Challenge 2
s1 = patientid

# Challenge 3
"patient" + 1

# Challenge 4
a = "123"
a + 5

# Challenge 1: "def" should be inside quotation marks.
# Challenge 2: "patientid" should be inside quotation marks.
# Challenge 3: "patient" is a string and cannot be added to numbers.
# Challenge 4: "123" is a string (because it's inside quotation marks), 
#              and therefore cannot be added to numbers.

== Lists and indexes
[source,python]
----
# You can store multiple values into a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# The values don't have to be the same type
my_list = [1, "a", "b", 2]

# You can find out the length of a list 
len(my_list)

# You can specify elements you want to include from a list [start_index : end_index_plus_1]
my_list[0:2]

# You can refer to different elements of the list by referring to its index
# In Python index starts with 0
my_list[0]
my_list[2]

# You can also refer to the index of a specific character in a string
my_sequence = "ATCG"
my_sequence[0]

# However, you cannot do the same with numbers
a = 123
a[0]
----


=== Challenge
[source,python]
----
# Challenge 1: Add the second element of both a and b to form the string "A2"
a = ["A", "A", "B"]
b = [1, 2, 4]

# Challenge 2: a) How many amino acid residues are there in this sequence. 
#              b) How many are there that's left over (i.e. less than 3 so don't form a codon). 
#              c) Please store the sequence code for codons (i.e. remove the nucleotides that don't form a condon). 
# Please write it in a way that you can change the sequence value into anything and would still work.
sequence = "ATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTT"

# Challenge 1: 
a[1] + str(b[1])
# Challenge 2: 
# a) The length of the sequence is 20, so there are 6 amino acid residues
int(len(sequence) / 3)
# b) The left overs from the division can be found through %
len(sequence) % 3
# c) You can use the answer from A to find the length of the sequence that form codons
num_residue = int(len(sequence) / 3)
new_sequence = sequence[0:(num_residue * 3 )]

== Dictionary
[source,python]
----
# You can use dictionary to store key:value pairs
# For example, you can use a dictionary to store the information on complementrary sequences
complement = { 'A': 'T',
                'T' : 'A',
                'C' : 'G',
                'G' : 'C' }
complement["A"]
complement["T"]

# key:value pairs in dictionary is useful for fast lookup
# The values in a dictionary can be a single value, another dictionary or a list.
# For example, you can store all the patient information using patient ID as key, and to retrieve the data
# Note that it's colon between key and value, not equal symbol.
patient_metadata = { 'Sub1' : {'age' : 60, 'gender' : 'M'},
                     'Sub2' : {'age' : 30, 'gender' : 'F'}, 
                     'Sub3' : {'age' : 45, 'gender' : 'F'},   }
patient_metadata['Sub2']['age']

=== Challenge
[source,python]

# Challenge 1: (fix the code below)
gender_convert = {"M" = "male", "F"= "female"}
# Challenge 2: Given the patient_metadata dictionary above, write code that will print out the patient age and gender in a continuous sentence
# For exampl, "Sub1 is 60 year-old and male."
# Hint 1 - set a variable that store each of the variables
patient_interest = "Sub1"
# Hint 2 - complete the line below
patient_interest_age = 
# Hint 3 - complete the line below
patient_interest_gender = 
# Hint 4 - you would need to make a dictionary that translate M and F in to male and female for patient_interest_gender.

# Hint 5 - put everything together (fix the error below)
patient_interest + " is " + patient_interest_age + " year-old and " + patient_interest_gender + "."

=== Loop
[source,python]
----
my_sequence = "ATCG"
# You can convert a string into a list 
my_sequence = list(my_sequence)
my_sequence

# By using loop, you can go through each element in a list.
for element in my_sequence:
