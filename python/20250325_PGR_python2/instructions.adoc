== Conditional

[source,python]
----
# You can check if something is true
# Equals
1 == 1
# Not equals
1 != 1
# Less than
1 < 1
# Less than or equal to
1 <= 1
# Greater than
1 > 1
# Greater than or equal to
1 >= 1

# The data type from this comparison is called Boolean (or Bool)
type(1>1)

----

[source,python]
----
# Conditional (If) statments can be used to ensure instruction are 
# only carried out when a condition is met
x = 11
if(x>10):
    # you can use %d to indicate digits, and %s to indicate string,
    # then put the variables for each substituted values at the end of the string
    print("%d is larger than 10." %(x))

# You can add an "else statment" to give instructions for
# when the condition is not met.
if(x>10):
    print("%d is larger than 10." %(x))
else:
    print("%d is smaller than or equal to 10." %(x))

# You can put the If statments inside a loop
# Remember to have the correct number of tabs
for x in range(20):
    if(x>10):
        print("%d is larger than 10." %(x))
    else:
        print("%d is smaller than or equal to 10." %(x))

# You can have an elseif statement, 
# then the conditions will be checked in order
for x in range(20):
    if(x>15):
        print("Great!")
    elif(15>x>10):
        print("Good")
    else:
        print("Not so good")

# You can check if a value is in a list/in the keys of a dictionary
a = "apple"
b = ["apple", "pear", "orange"]
c = {"apple": 1, "banana": "orange", "pear": 0}
a in b
a in c
"pear" in c

if(a in b):
    print("a is in b")
else:
    print("a is not in b")

# You can also check if some letters are in a string
"a" in "apple"
".txt" in "sample_list.txt"

# You can use "and" and "or" to combine conditions
# You don't have to have the brackets, but I find it improves readability
("a" in "apple") and ("b" in "banana")
("a" in "apple") and ("b" in "pear")
("a" in "apple") or ("b" in "pear")
("a" in "apple") or (1 > 10)

# Challenge 1
# Given the dictionary above, why is the below False?
"orange" in c 
# Challenge 2
# Fix the code below (4 errors)
x = "10"
if(x = 10):
print("x is 10")
    else:
    print("x is not 10")

== Functions 

[source,python]
----
# You can make a function to bundle a set of instructions
# This is often what you're using when you use tools developed by others
# Learning about how you make your own function can help 
# understanding how to use functions developed by other people.

# Create a simple function that prints a message
def say_something(x):
    out = "Say " + x
    return(out)

say_something("hey")

# Values in a function are often defined as x, 
# but you can define it with other variable names tools
def say_something(something):
    out = "Say " + something
    return(out)
say_something("hey")

# You can have more than 1 value
def say_something(x, y):
    out = "Say " + x + ", and then " + y
    return(out)
say_something("hey", "there")

# By default the function will assume the input values (parameters) are entered in order
# (i.e. the first value is the first variable, the second value is the second variable)
# However, you can also specify your parameters
say_something(x = "first value", y = "second value")

# Notice that when you specify your input values, it will assign the value to the
# correct parameters and you can enter your parameters "out of order"
# This is why in tutorials on how to use an existing tool,
# sometimes the parameters have specified (e.g. x=), 
# and often they are not specified 
# (because the tutorial entered the parameters in the order they are stated in the function)
say_something(y = "first value", x = "second value")


# You can have pre-defined value for your functions
def say_something(x = "nothing"):
    out = "Say " + x
    return(out)

# Then you don't have to put any parameters to call the function
say_something()

=== Challenge
[source,python]
----
# Challenge 1
# Make a function that takes in two parameters (a number and a string), 
# and print out something like "5 samples" 
# when "5" and "samples" were given to the function

# Challenge 2
# Make a function that converts Celicus to Kelvin
# And print "It's very hot" if it's more than 35 Celicus 
# Kelvin is Celsius + 273.15

# Challenge 3
# Write a function that can convert a given DNA sequence into its complementrary sequence.
# It should be able to accept both lower and upper case as inputs
# It should print N for anything that's not ATCG

# Challenge 1: 
def print_fun(x, y):
    out = str(x) + " " + y
    return(out)

# Challenge 2: 
def temp_convert(C):
    K = C + 273.15
    if C > 35:
        print("It's very hot")
    return(K)

# Challenge 3:
def complement_my_dna(sequence):
    # Dictionary that containing information on what is the complementrary sequence
    complement_dict = {"A": "T", "T" : "A", "C" : "G", "G" : "C"}
    # Empty string that will become the complementrary sequence
    out_sequence=""
    # Because my dictionary only has capital letters,
    # Convert the input sequence into all capital letters
    sequence = sequence.upper()
    # do this for each of the nucleotide in the input sequence
    for nucleotide in sequence:
        # Get the complementrary nucleotide
        if(nucleotide in complement_dict):
            complement_nucleotide = complement_dict[nucleotide]
        else:
            complement_nucleotide = "N"
        # Add the new nucleotide to the output sequence
        out_sequence = out_sequence + complement_nucleotide

=== Import library


[source,python]
----
# You can import libraries with functions that allow you to do specific tasks.
# Related phrases you may have heard include packages and modules.
# There are subtle differences between these terms in python, but don't worry about them for now.

# Python has several standard libraries that are already installed
# Import the os library - this library allows python to interact with your operating system
import os

# This allows you to list all the files/folders in a specified folder (dir/directory) 
# (or your current working directory if not specified)
os.listdir()

# You an specify a folder
os.listdir("OneDrive - Lancaster University")

# You can use slashes to indicate subfolders
# Notice that Python uses forward slashes (/) when indicating folders,
# whereas Windows use backward slashes (\)
# If you copied your folder path from Windows, remember to change the slashes
os.listdir("OneDrive - Lancaster University/example_data")

# You can also change your working directory
# Once you have changed your working directory, 
# this folder becomes your point of reference
os.chdir("OneDrive - Lancaster University/example_data")
os.listdir()

# You can check if something is a file or a folder (dir/directory)
os.isdir("collected_data")

----


[source,python]
----
## Challenge 1: Change your working directory to a different folder

## Challenge 2: List files/folders in a folder

## Challenge 3: Download the example_data folder as a zip file and extract it.
# Print out the names of all files/folders within the (first level of) example_data.
# Hint: You can use os.isdir() to check if something is a file or a folder (dir/directory)

## Challenge 3:
# Folder for looping through 
main_folder = "C:/Users/shihb/local_documents/collected_data"
# list the directories in your folder
filefoler_list = os.listdir(main_folder)# Loop through the files within each folder (dir/directory)
for filefolder in filefoler_list:
    # Add the path from your folder to form the full path for each of the file/subfolder
    filefolder_path = main_folder + "/" + filefolder

    # Check if this is a file or a folder
    # Only perform the following if it is a folder
    if os.isdir(filefolder_path):
        # Find out what files are in the subfolder referred to in the current loop
        files_in_subfolder = os.listdir(subfolder_path)
        # Go through each of these files and print them out
        for current_file in files_in_subfolder:
            # Add the file path from your folder to form the full file path for each of the subfolder
            print(current_file)

== Pandas: Navigating dataframes
[source,python]
----
# Pandas and numpy are two libraries that are commonly used for data processing in python
# Numpy uses slightly different data structure from the traditional python lists,
# which makes it substantially faster when used well.
# Therefore, a lot of the data-centric libraries use numpy.
# Pandas uses numpy and is useful for data cleaning and processing. 
# Pandas is also commonly used in data wrangling and by bioinformatics tools.

# Change your working directory to the folder containing the downloaded example_data

# You can import a library and give it a short name
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read in a csv file
metadata = pd.read_csv("example_data/metadata/subject.csv")

# Take a look at the imported data
metadata

# Look at the object type
type(metadata)

# You can find out the dtat types for each column
metadata.dtypes

# You can find out the shape (rows, columns) of the data frame 
metadata.shape

# You can get a list of column names
metadata.columns

# You can get a list of indexes (row names)
metadata.index


# You can look at the top/bottom of the data
# The pandas.core.frame.DataFrame object type has associated functions
# Much like how you can do "abc".upper() that turns the string into "ABC"
# Or how "-".join(["a","b","c"]) makes "a-b-c"
metadata.head()
metadata.tail()

# You can specify the top 5
metadata.head(5)


# You can refer to a specific column by using . or [column_name]
metadata.subject_id
metadata["subject_id"]

# Check the data type for columns
type(metadata.subject_id)

# You can turn the data type into lists
list(metadata.subject_id)


# You can set a column as your index
metadata.set_index(metadata.subject_id)

# You can find out the unique values for a column
pd.unique(metadata['treatment'])


----

== Pandas: Working with data
[source,python]
----
# You can get an overview on data
metadata.age.describe()
metadata.age.min()
metadata.age.max()
metadata.age.mean()
metadata.age.std()
metadata.age.count()

# Remember you can also use square brackets to refer to columns
metadata['age'].count()

# You can group data by columns
grouped_data = metadata.groupby('gender')
grouped_data.describe()

# You can write the above in one single line
metadata.groupby('gender').describe()

metadata.groupby('gender').describe()['count']
